The dove king🕊️👑 encouraged them to fly a little further.The smallest dove picked up speed and found some rice 🍚 scattered beneath a banyan tree🌳 so all the doves landed and began to eat.
Suddenly a net🕸️ fell over them and they were all trapped. They saw a hunter🏹 approaching carring a huge club. The doves desperately fluttered their wings trying to get out but to no avail. The king👑 had an idea.He adviced all the doves to fly up together carrying the net with them. He said that there was strength💪 in unity. Each dove picked up a Portion of the net and together they flew off carrying the net🕸️ with them. The hunter looked up in astonishment😲He tried to follow them,but they were flying High over the hills and valleys🏞️. They flew to a hill near a city🏙️ of temples where there lived a mouse 🐁 who could help them. He was a faithful friend of the dove king 🕊️👑.
When the mouse heard the loud noise of their approach,he went into hiding. The dove king 🕊️👑 gently called out to him and then the mouse 🐁 was happy to see him.
The dove king explained that they had been caught in a trap and needed the mouse's help to gnaw at the net with his teeth and set them free. The mouse agreed saying that he would set the king free first. The king insisted that he first free his subjects and the king last. The mouse understood the king's feelings and complied with his wishes. He began to cut the net and one by one all the doves were freed including the dove king.
They all thanked the mouse 🐁 and flew away together,United in their strength.
